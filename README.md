# Probability Distributome Project

The <a href="http://distributome.org/">Probability Distributome Project</a> is an open-source, open content-development project
for exploring, discovering, navigating, learning, and computational utilization of diverse probability distributions. 

Probability distributions are functions assigning  probabilities to events. For example, rolling a fair hexagonal
die generates 6 possible equally likely outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), each having a chance to be observed proportionally-equal
to the dieâ€™s loading factors. 

The current latest version of the Distributome source code is <a href="https://github.com/idinov/distributome/tree/master/web_site/V3">V3</a>.

The <a href="https://github.com/idinov/distributome">Distributome Navigator</a> is a webapp demonstration of many of the Distributome computational and interface functionalities.
